### Hi there, I'm Gautam Mudbhari 👋

**AI Researcher | Cloud Data Engineer | Full Stack Developer**

I specialize in building high-precision AI models and scalable cloud architectures. From engineering proprietary healthcare access control systems with **96% precision** to training autonomous agents in simulations, I bridge the gap between theoretical research and production-ready software.
